    "The Institute of Materials Research and Engineering would like to extract the core skills of its staff based on their scientific publications in peer reviewed journals. A record of these publications are available in the \"Publication Release Form\" database. This work extracts keywords from each publication's title and abstract, and match (store) these keywords with the respective first authors, who are assumed to be the experts in the subject knowledge. I.e. the staff expertise is constituted by the contents of their first-author publications."
