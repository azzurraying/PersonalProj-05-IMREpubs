       " 'Biodegradable Thermogelling Polymers for Biomedical Applications  Thermogelling polymers belong to a class of stimuli-responsive hydrogels that undergo a macroscopic sol-to-gel transition in response to temperature. Much of the ongoing research in this fi eld is focused on hydrogels for biomedical applications as an injectable sustained drug-release matrix or scaffolds for tissue regeneration. Despite robust developments in biodegradable thermogelling polymers in recent decades, the fi eld still faces challenges in the optimization of materials properties. Thorough investigation must be performed to understand the effectiveness of drug delivery using hydrogel-forming polymer carriers. A highlighted case study on OncoGel, an experimental drug delivery depot formulation, sheds some light on the shortcomings of biodegradable thermogelling polymers as drug delivery systems. In this article, we highlight developments in biodegradable thermoresponsive polymers for biomedical applications over the past three years, with a focus on materials/ technical challenges and the approaches used to resolve these problems.

Degradation process of the devices has been monitored using impedance spectrometer under light, and dynamic parameters changes have been derived by model fitting, which are unable to provide information regarding the different stages of device changes though. However, layer analysis tested using impedance spectrometer in dark, provided exact information of devices layers and interfaces changes during degradation process. Higher capacitance at PEDOT-ITO interface and higher resistance at PEDOT-P3HT interface, and PEDOT bulk layers performance fluctuations contributed to the beginning stages of device degradation. The degradation of P3HT:PCBM layer indicates the starting of the final device irreversible degradation.  ',\n",

This technique has since been demonstrated in conjunction with standard tomographic techniques for reconstructing the 3D RI distribution of axially symmetrical optical fibers, and fibers exhibiting a variation in RI along the length including long period gratings. Using these techniques, in addition to being able to extract the fundamental period of the grating, we were able to reconstruct the refractive index profile of the fiber core and index variations associated with the grating. Given its non-destructive nature as well as strength in characterisation of specimens with weak phase variations, this technique is also advantageous for application to the imaging of biological samples.

The pinch-off voltage shifted towards enhancement mode type operation behavior due to the Ge diffusion on the surface of the thin GaN cap layer. An anomalous hump observed in high frequency C-V plot is due to the electron confinement at the Ge-GaN/AlGaN interface. The threshold voltage reduces by 0.8 to 1.0 V after Ge diffusion. The drive current and the transconductance further reduced as compared to the control sample due to the parallel channel formation at the top Ge-GaN/AlGaN interfaces.  ',\n",

It explores the properties of surface plasmons in tight light connement, strongly localized optical eld and the enhancement of evanescent field for super-resolution imaging and lithography.Upon the distinct interactions between the light and nanostructures, the PNL is categorized into three types, i.e. enhanced near-field lithography (ENL), superlens (planar lens) lithography (SLL) and focused plasmonic lithography (FPL).

       " 'Temperature-dependent phase separation during annealing of Ge2Sb2Te5 thin films in vacuum  Thermal stability of 100 nm Ge2Sb2Te5 thin film during annealing from room temperature to 240?C inside a UHV chamber was studied in situ by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and ex situ by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Ge species are found to diffuse preferentially to the surface when GST film is annealed from 25?C to 100?C. This process is accompanied by a change of phase whereby the amorphous film completely becomes face-center-cubic (FCC) phase at 100 ?C. From 100?C to 200?C, both Sb and Te species are observed to diffuse more to the surface. The FCC phase is partially changed into hexagonal-close-pack (HCP) phase at 200?C. At 220?C, FCC phase is completely transformed into HCP phase. Loss of Sb and Te are also detected from the surface and this is attributed to desorption due to their high vapor pressures. At 240 ?C, Sb and Te species are found to have desorbed completely from the surface, and leave behind Ge-rich 3D droplets on the surface. The separation of Ge2Sb2Te5 into Sb,Te-rich phase and Ge-rich phase is thus the main mechanism to account for the failure of Ge2Sb2Te5-based phase change memory devices under thermal stress.  ',\n",

Here, we report highly efficient continuous-wave terahertz emission using nanogap electrodes in a photoconductive antenna-based photomixer.

Furthermore, by integrating a layer of photoresponsive liquid crystals (LCs) with the gold nanostructure to form a hybrid system, we observed a red-shift of transmission peak wavelength. More importantly, the peak intensity can be further enhanced more than 10% in transmittance due to the refractive index match of the media on both sides of it. By optically pumping the hybrid system using a UV light, nematic-isotropic phase transition of the LCs was achieved, thus changing the effective refractive index experienced by the impinging light.

       " 'Degradation Mechanisms and Electron Kinetics Analysis in Aging Dye Sensitized Solar Cell Using Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy  Degradation sequence and electron kinetics in an aging dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) is proposed based on the results of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The degradation begins with desorption of excess dye which leads to efficiency improvement and an increase in both the open-circuit voltage (VOC) and charge transfer resistance (RCT). Subsequent degradation mechanisms leading to steady reduction in the efficiency include infiltration of electrolyte into the mesoporous TiO2 film and aggregation of dye. The former leads to more active recapturing of injected electron by the redox couple and is associated with a reduction of RCT due to higher electron exchange current. Dye aggregation is proposed to be the main degradation mechanism at the end of the aging period. This is substantiated on the increase in RCT along with the decline in the chemical capacitance of TiO2, C.  ',\n",

       " 'Evidence for the interfacial reaction between Ni adatoms and H-Si(001) surface  Hydrogen termination of Si surfaces (H-Si) does not stop the interfacial reaction between Ni adatoms and HSi(001) surface at room temperature. At low Ni coverage of 0.1% (equivalent to 0.02 ML), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) reveals a binding energy shift of Ni 2p3/2 to 854.0 eV, which corresponds to the formation a NiSi-like environment. As the coverage of Ni increases, the Ni 2p3/2 eventually shifts to 852.8 eV, indicative of formation of metallic Ni. XPS intensity vs Ni coverage analysis reveals a growth process akin to pseudolayer- by-layer growth mode, thereby suggesting the formation of bulk-Si(001)/NiSi-like/Ni-rich-silicide-like/ metallic Ni structure as growth proceeds. For Ni coverage not more that 33% (equivalent to 12.68 ML), Ni remains protected by the silicide environment and no oxidation of Ni to form Ni-oxides was observed even after exposing the samples to air for 400 days. For samples with Ni coverage above 41%, oxidation of Ni is observed by presence of NiO and NiSiO3 peaks at 854.5 and 857.0 eV, respectively. The current studies suggest that there is reaction between Ni adatoms and Si at the growth front on H-Si(001) surfaces upon Ni deposition at room temperature and hydrogen termination does not suppress the interface reaction between Ni and Si.

As studied by discrete dipole approximation (DDA) simulations, the entire nanocross gets excited even when one of the branches is exposed to incident light. The above properties make them useful as octopus antennas for capturing near-IR light for effective photothermal destruction of cells. The cell damage process was analyzed using the Arrhenius model, and its intrinsic thermodynamic characteristics were determined quantitatively.

The surface states introduced in the Si band gap by removing H atoms from a Si(001)-(21)-H surface were calculated and also analyzed using a simple tight-binding model. The two-channel surface conductance of a DB wire results from a combination of through-space and through-lattice electronic couplings between DB states. The conductance of the DB wire-H-junction-DB wire structure decreases exponentially with the length of H junction with an inverse decay rate ranging from 0.20 to 0.23 -1, depending on the energy. When the DB wire-H-junction-DB wire structure is contacted by Au nanoelectrodes, the transmission resonances corresponding to the DB wire states split, demonstrating a coupling of the DB wires through short surface hydrogen atomic junctions. This splitting decreases with the length of H junction between the DB wires with an inverse decay length ranging from 0.22 to 0.44 -1, indicating that such an atomic scale surface tunneling junction is not a very good insulator.
