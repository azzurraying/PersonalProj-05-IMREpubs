       " 'Biodegradable Thermogelling Polymers for Biomedical Applications  Thermogelling polymers belong to a class of stimuli-responsive hydrogels that undergo a macroscopic sol-to-gel transition in response to temperature. Much of the ongoing research in this fi eld is focused on hydrogels for biomedical applications as an injectable sustained drug-release matrix or scaffolds for tissue regeneration. Despite robust developments in biodegradable thermogelling polymers in recent decades, the fi eld still faces challenges in the optimization of materials properties. Thorough investigation must be performed to understand the effectiveness of drug delivery using hydrogel-forming polymer carriers. A highlighted case study on OncoGel, an experimental drug delivery depot formulation, sheds some light on the shortcomings of biodegradable thermogelling polymers as drug delivery systems. In this article, we highlight developments in biodegradable thermoresponsive polymers for biomedical applications over the past three years, with a focus on materials/ technical challenges and the approaches used to resolve these problems.

Most importantly, the latter films showed no trace of copper (used as the catalyst) thus obviating the need for post-deposition processing and avoiding adverse effects of the metal leaching during service. Finally both the PSBMA films from both the methods were exposed to hMSCs cells and higher inhibition rate was observed for the CO2-EL processed PSBMA compared to conventional PSBMA films.

This technique has since been demonstrated in conjunction with standard tomographic techniques for reconstructing the 3D RI distribution of axially symmetrical optical fibers, and fibers exhibiting a variation in RI along the length including long period gratings. Using these techniques, in addition to being able to extract the fundamental period of the grating, we were able to reconstruct the refractive index profile of the fiber core and index variations associated with the grating. Given its non-destructive nature as well as strength in characterisation of specimens with weak phase variations, this technique is also advantageous for application to the imaging of biological samples.

The enhancement in light absorption in the cell was measured with UV-vis absorption spectroscopy, by measurements of the photo-induced carriers generation rate, and verified by a calculation of optical electric field distribution. The ZnO layer used to improve the light-harvesting increases the charge collection efficiency, serves as a blocking layer for holes, and reduces the recombination rate. The combined optical and electrical improvements raise the power conversion efficiency of solution-processed small-molecule solar cells to 8.94%; i.e. comparable to that of polymer counterparts.

Ge species are found to diffuse preferentially to the surface when GST film is annealed from 25?C to 100?C. This process is accompanied by a change of phase whereby the amorphous film completely becomes face-center-cubic (FCC) phase at 100 ?C. From 100?C to 200?C, both Sb and Te species are observed to diffuse more to the surface. The FCC phase is partially changed into hexagonal-close-pack (HCP) phase at 200?C. At 220?C, FCC phase is completely transformed into HCP phase. Loss of Sb and Te are also detected from the surface and this is attributed to desorption due to their high vapor pressures. At 240 ?C, Sb and Te species are found to have desorbed completely from the surface, and leave behind Ge-rich 3D droplets on the surface. The separation of Ge2Sb2Te5 into Sb,Te-rich phase and Ge-rich phase is thus the main mechanism to account for the failure of Ge2Sb2Te5-based phase change memory devices under thermal stress.  ',\n",

Here, we report highly efficient continuous-wave terahertz emission using nanogap electrodes in a photoconductive antenna-based photomixer.

Furthermore, by integrating a layer of photoresponsive liquid crystals (LCs) with the gold nanostructure to form a hybrid system, we observed a red-shift of transmission peak wavelength. More importantly, the peak intensity can be further enhanced more than 10% in transmittance due to the refractive index match of the media on both sides of it. By optically pumping the hybrid system using a UV light, nematic-isotropic phase transition of the LCs was achieved, thus changing the effective refractive index experienced by the impinging light. Due to the refractive index change, the transmission peak intensity was modulated accordingly. As a result, an optically tunable plasmonic color filter was achieved.

Subsequent degradation mechanisms leading to steady reduction in the efficiency include infiltration of electrolyte into the mesoporous TiO2 film and aggregation of dye. The former leads to more active recapturing of injected electron by the redox couple and is associated with a reduction of RCT due to higher electron exchange current. Dye aggregation is proposed to be the main degradation mechanism at the end of the aging period.

       " 'Evidence for the interfacial reaction between Ni adatoms and H-Si(001) surface  Hydrogen termination of Si surfaces (H-Si) does not stop the interfacial reaction between Ni adatoms and HSi(001) surface at room temperature. At low Ni coverage of 0.1% (equivalent to 0.02 ML), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) reveals a binding energy shift of Ni 2p3/2 to 854.0 eV, which corresponds to the formation a NiSi-like environment. As the coverage of Ni increases, the Ni 2p3/2 eventually shifts to 852.8 eV, indicative of formation of metallic Ni. XPS intensity vs Ni coverage analysis reveals a growth process akin to pseudolayer- by-layer growth mode, thereby suggesting the formation of bulk-Si(001)/NiSi-like/Ni-rich-silicide-like/ metallic Ni structure as growth proceeds. For Ni coverage not more that 33% (equivalent to 12.68 ML), Ni remains protected by the silicide environment and no oxidation of Ni to form Ni-oxides was observed even after exposing the samples to air for 400 days. For samples with Ni coverage above 41%, oxidation of Ni is observed by presence of NiO and NiSiO3 peaks at 854.5 and 857.0 eV, respectively. The current studies suggest that there is reaction between Ni adatoms and Si at the growth front on H-Si(001) surfaces upon Ni deposition at room temperature and hydrogen termination does not suppress the interface reaction between Ni and Si.

The multiple branching was achieved by breaking the face-centered-cubic lattice symmetry of gold through copper-induced formation of single or double twins, and the resulting gold nanocrosses exhibited pronounced near-IR absorption with a great extension to the mid-IR region. As studied by discrete dipole approximation (DDA) simulations, the entire nanocross gets excited even when one of the branches is exposed to incident light. The above properties make them useful as octopus antennas for capturing near-IR light for effective photothermal destruction of cells. The cell damage process was analyzed using the Arrhenius model, and its intrinsic thermodynamic characteristics were determined quantitatively. Besides effective photothermal treatment and two-photon luminescence imaging, the near- and mid-IR-absorbing gold nanocrosses may also find applications in IR sensing, thermal imaging, telecommunications, and the like.

The gears can be manipulated one by one, using an atomic force microscope (AFM) tip, to construct a train of gears where mechanical motion can be transmitted from one gear to another by mastering the surface friction.

Sufficient time durations for ZnO growth and dye loading were required for achieving optimum photoconversion efficiency. Extending these two time parameters beyond the optimal, however, reduced the efficiency due to nanorod defects and dye agglomerations. The mechanisms inducing the change in the efficiency was reflected in the LFN spectral and explained on the basis of Kleinpennings noise equation and excessive noises in the presence of structural defects.

The surface states introduced in the Si band gap by removing H atoms from a Si(001)-(21)-H surface were calculated and also analyzed using a simple tight-binding model. The two-channel surface conductance of a DB wire results from a combination of through-space and through-lattice electronic couplings between DB states. The conductance of the DB wire-H-junction-DB wire structure decreases exponentially with the length of H junction with an inverse decay rate ranging from 0.20 to 0.23 -1, depending on the energy. When the DB wire-H-junction-DB wire structure is contacted by Au nanoelectrodes, the transmission resonances corresponding to the DB wire states split, demonstrating a coupling of the DB wires through short surface hydrogen atomic junctions. This splitting decreases with the length of H junction between the DB wires with an inverse decay length ranging from 0.22 to 0.44 -1, indicating that such an atomic scale surface tunneling junction is not a very good insulator.

TiO2 was imprinted using a polymerizable liquid TiO2 resin consisting of a mixture of titanium methacrylate, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, and azobis-(isobutyronitrile). The resin underwent free radical polymerization when imprinted using a silicon mold at 110 C with pressures as low as 10 bar. Polymerization strengthens the imprinted structures, thereby giving ~100% yield after demolding.
